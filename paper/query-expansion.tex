\section{Query Expansion}

\subsection{ChatGPT}%Christian

We used ChatGPT to expand the query with keywords. For this we used the following prompts, where \$STANCE and \$TOPIC are replaced by the respective stance and topic:

\begin{quote}
    Name a list of arguments \$STANCE "\$TOPIC"
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
    For each of the arguments, what could be an image description of an image illustrating the issue?
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
    Can you summarize each image description in the form of a search query?
\end{quote}
