\section{Reranking}

\subsection{IBM Project Debater}

We used IBM's Project Debater Early Access API to score the text content of a Website.

For this we used the "pro-con" endpoint, which given two sentences returns the stance of the first sentence relative to the second sentence as a number between -1 (CON) and 1 (PRO).

We applied this by first splitting the website text content into sentences and then ranking each sentence of the document relative to the current search query. The stance of the document as a whole is then computed as the average of all individual text stances.
